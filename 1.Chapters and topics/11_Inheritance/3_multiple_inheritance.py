''' 
Most Imp : if we want to print a detail which is mentioned in 2 parent classes then what will print?
--> (employee(1),programmer(2)) in checks what is first inside the class then it will print the first one (1).
'''
print(shiv.company) # this will print priority wise like (1:own class) , (2:class first mentioned in the class)
